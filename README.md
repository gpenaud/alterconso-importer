# Overview

[cagette-importer ðŸ’»](https://github.com/gpenaud/cagette-importer) is a microservice, developped in python, which allows you to easily import cagette Products, manage its taxonomy (through deduction and insertion of its related TxpCategory, TxpSubcategory and TxpProduct). The goal of that microservice is to import exported products from currently [official cagette](https://app.cagette.net)

Usage of this microservice is difficult and requires some advanced skills, that's why its usage will no be free ; that will allow me to pay my bills, so if you prefer pay a few instead of importing all of your products manually, please contact me on my mail address: **guillaume.penaud@gmail.com** for more information.
